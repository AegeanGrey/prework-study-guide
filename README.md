# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I was motivated to to build a website through agile, computational thinking and adopting a growth mindset.
- I built this webpage to provide coding bootcamp students (like me) an area to where they can study Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- This is meant to help those who are new to learning coding languages better understand the common terminologies and practices used in everday projects through the provided notes on the webpage
- I gained knowledge on how the following is utilized for building webpages:

HTML establishes the foundation of the website, providing content to populate onto a given webpage.

CSS (when linked to the HTML Sheet) provides shaping and styling to the HTML elements, making the UI more appealing for the end user.

JavaScript creates functionality within our website, having our code be more flexible and enhancing the UX.

## Installation

## Features

If you're unsure where to start your studying or just want to review notes at random, I've provided a randomizer built through JavaScript that will pick one!

Here's how to use it:

1.) Open the Prework Study Guide Webpage
2.) Right Click anywhere on the page and select, "Inspect Element" or "Ctrl + Shift + C" on Windows
3.) On the pop-up to the right hand side of the page towards the top, you should see that your on the "Element" Tab.
4.) Click on the "Console" Tab

You should then see all of the available topics on webpage and which one it recommends to study! 

If you want to study something else then refresh the browser until you find what you want.
